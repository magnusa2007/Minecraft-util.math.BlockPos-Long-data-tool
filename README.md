# Minecraft-util.math.BlockPos-Long-data-tool
Converter BlockPos.fromLong(1.16) also known as BlockPos.of

Known as net.minecraft.core.BlockPos.of and Minecraft-util.math.BlockPos(fromLong,toLong)

Do `java tool.java` to run it and give it either xyz like `> 213 43 123` witch then converts it into the long format `58548994682923` and vice versa.
Reason i made this is because a refinded storage node broke and it only shows the long format in `refinedstorage_nodes.dat`
